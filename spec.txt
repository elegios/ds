ds init <folder> //creates folder, creates symlink from ~/.ds-folder to folder

ds add <file> //moves file to ds-folder and creates a symlink to it in its place
              //also adds a pair of location and name, probably with some logic to guarantee uniquenes
ds rem <file> //replaces the symlink with a copy of the file in ds-folder and marks the file to be unsynced
              //when all cloned computers have removed it (via sync?) the file in ds-folder is removed
              //NOTE: this would simply remove the file from all other computers, not ideal

ds clone <ds-folder> //makes symlinks to files in ds-folder, makes a symlink ~/.ds-folder to ds-folder
                     //adds this computer to a list of cloned computers

ds list //lists all synced files

//tracker-file/register-file
needs to keep track of what files are used, but should probably do it
by tracking exclusions, rather than inclusions, as most computers will
probably use all, or almost all, files.

files:
  filename-in-ds-folder: path relative to ~

computers:
  hostname?:
    exclusions


First version:

ds init <folder> //creates folder, creates symlink from ~/.ds-folder to folder
                 //creates a file in ds-folder, <hostname>.(yaml?json?something human readable)

ds add <file> //moves file to ds-folder, replacing it with a symlink, and adds an entry to <hostname>.<something>

ds rem <file> //copies file from ds-folder to replace the file, also removes an entry from <hostname>.<something>

ds clone <ds-folder> <hostname> // clones the ds setup from <hostname>.<something> to the current computer
                                // TODO: lots of thinking, should probably be an interactive command as it's 
                                // quite destructive
